        <h3><center>Who are we?</center></h3>
        <p>
        We are the Mount Holyoke's competitive womxn's ulimate team and compete in the New England D3 Region. Daisy Chain was founded in 2005 by a small group of frisbee loving individuals. In the 15 years since our founding, the team has grown in size and competition level! 
        <br><br> We have been regionally since our founding and nationally competitive since 2016. We have attended Nationals every year since then, with our best result T-5 in 2018. 
        <br><br> During the 2019-2020 season we had 40 players regularaly attending practices and team events! In the 2020-2021 season we plan to split into competitive A and B teams. The B team allows players to join at a lower competition level, while still benefiting from playing the sport in college! Both teams will recieve comparable resources and attend tournaments around the region. 
      </p>

        <h3><center>What do we do?</center></h3>
        <p> 
        We practice year-round on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings, and have team workouts on Sundays. Many weekends in September, October, March, and April are spent at tournaments. Players on the A team should be fully committed to the team and attend are expected to attend every practice and tournament. B team players are not held to strict attendance guidelines. <br><br>
        In the fall we attend tournaments across New England and split into two teams of equal skill level to encourage player growth. In the spring our A team attends tournaments in the region. All players are welcome and encouraged to attend our spring training trip during at the High Tide Ultimate tournament in Myrtle Beach, SC. If our A team does well enough during the spring season, we may have the chance to continue playing together and attend the D3 National Championships in May!
